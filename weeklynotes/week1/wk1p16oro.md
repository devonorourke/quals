### Major observations

#### Islands are well suited for studying evolutionary processes
- The relatively young age enables rapid diversification from colonizing species because niches have yet to be filled
- Because of the idiosyncratic nature of each island's evolutionary patterns, coupled with the fact that there are many islands in geographically similar and disparate locales, a researcher can potentially observe seemingly replicate evolutionary experiments

#### Evolutionary processes comprise two factors: divergence and adaptation
- **The size of the island matters**. In trying to understand which of the two processes are required first to enable speciation to occur, a survey of islands and their resulting species abundance suggest that when islands are sufficiently small, there is no speciation; however on very large islands there can be evidence of speciation. The message here is that allopatry is the first step in promoting speciation to occur, not adaptation. The caveat is that if you have a series of small islands (aka. archipelago) then you can observe rampant speciation (hello Galapagos finches!). In fact, archipelago's hit a kind of sweet spot where the islands are far enough to reduce gene flow to promote speciation, yet close enough for every island to be rapidly occupied and diversification to occur.
- **The age of the island matters**. Islands age and the consequence is that extinction rates generally result in fewer species than migration can introduce. Habitat degradation and erosion can also diminsh the species richness (from sheer habitat loss). As time progresses there may be potential for previously allopatric populations to expand their territories and encroach on the other populations/species' territory; the result is for increased competition and potential extinction. 

#### Adaptive radiation: (allopatry + sympatry second) * competition = ecological space filled up
- As mentioned above, speciation begins with a physical separation (allopatry). The two populations acquire enough differences to be thought of as two species. Should those two species begin to migrate back into their initial territories and overlap in space, sympatry must prevail through divergent use of ecological resources. With increased competition new adaptations will arise to reduce overlapping niches leading to evolutionary divergence. Further divergence among sympatric populations is then driven by *character displacement*, a phenomenon that describes a situation where to populations appear more different when occupying shared ecological space than if observed in isolation (that is, without competition).
- Alternative ways to drive adaptive radiation can be from essentially deriving new niches through the initial diversification itself:  
  - Some plants may initially adapt to unique climates. Should they then migrate back to their original habitats as a collective, they may be able to occupy unique microclimates.
  - Some instance of radiation of trophic levels enabled multiple species to coevolve; in this case adaptations through competitive interactions are not driven by partitioning a common ecological space, but through predator-prey interactions
- The authors note that just because you observe phenotypic variation there isn't necessarily an adaptive reason for it: the observed cladogenesis may be, in part, a result of drift or perhaps sexual selection.

#### Contingency and determinism:
