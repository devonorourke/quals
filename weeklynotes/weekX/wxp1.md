# King and Jukes notes:  

## Point 1
Patterns of evolutionary change at the phenotypic level may not be refelcted in the genotypic level. The "rules" of these changes may be different.  

## Point 2
While adaptive evolutionary change is brought about by (genetic) mutation, the process of natural selection acting to make the observed physical/behavioral (phenotype) changes does not necessarily apply to the source material (the genotype). It may be that genetic changes (mutations) have occurred that have no impact on the fitness of the organism and are neutral, thus NOT under selection.  

## Point 3
The idea that the pheontype can be under selection while the genotype would not be was not widely accepted. Ultra conservative Darwinians would likely proffer that selection among phenotype and genotype are inextricably linked.  

## Point 4
Classical Darwinists mistake natural selection for a force instead of a process. They quote Simpson (quoting Weiss) making an argument that because these biological levels are linked (the genotype determines the phenotype determines the organism determines the population...), natural selection must be the "composer" of the genome. The authors of this paper refute that, and state that natural selection is the "editor" rather than a composer.  

## Point 5
It seems like King and Jukes are over stating their counterparts... The idea that there is an optimal fitness for every point of evolutionary time isn't necessarily wrong, it's just wrong if you assume that optimal phenotype is always the same over evolutionary time (which it won't be because environments change). It may be that there is an optimal phenotype that is determined right down to the very amino acids present (that is, there really is an optimal form), but it may also be that there are multiple "optimal forms" which are unique/different for a single environment at one time.
