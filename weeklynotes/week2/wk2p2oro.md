### Major observations

#### Islands are well suited for studying evolutionary processes
- The relatively young age enables rapid diversification from colonizing species because niches have yet to be filled
- Because of the idiosyncratic nature of each island's evolutionary patterns, coupled with the fact that there are many islands in geographically similar and disparate locales, a researcher can potentially observe seemingly replicate evolutionary experiments
