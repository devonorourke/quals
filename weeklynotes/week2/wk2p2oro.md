#Week 2 - O'Rourke notes  

## Paper2: Gould and Lewontin 1979 (review)
You can actually get a really good summary of this through Wikipedia [here] [link1]

### Major observations
1. Adaptationists shoudln't think of organisms as a collection of discrete traits, but as a larger entity. Like an organism! Parts are integrated, thus a "chin" isn't a thing as much as a collection of developmental instructions (make jaw bone, make portion for teeth) colliding.  
2. If an organism is treated as discrete units, then optimalization is throught of as sum of parts. This means fitness of an organism is forever thought of in terms of tradeoffs.
3. Adaptationists, if confronted with a evidence that their current theory is wrong will switch to a different adaptive answer for a given trait's existence. Or just state that nature is complex, and we don't fully understand why a certain function exists as it does, *but it must be adaptive* (or so one maintains).


### Other observations
- It seems like Gould and Lewontin set up an argument that if you're not in favor of accepting their exaptation paradigm, then you must believe that all physical traits are the result of selection. Why can't it be a result of contingency?
- Why are trex arms so short anyway?

## Suggested readings
We need to tackle King and Jukes next. Natural selection is not the driving force behind most of the observed change we see. Gould and Lewontin's angle is that it can be because of things other than direct selection, and while they offer up drift as being discarded by 'adaptationists', they don't exactly go into detail as to how important it might be.
