## Paper13: Lewontin 1970 (review)
See [this review][link3] for a little bit of background regarding this lengthy paper.  

### Major observations

#### Selection can occur at multiple levels of organization
Lewontin abstracts from a biological population (interbreeding group of organisms) and uses the term more loosely to define it simply as a pair of groups. For selection to act on those two populations (be they ecosystems, individuals, or actual ecological populations), all that is required is:  
1. Variation among phenotypes  
2. Variation among fitnesses  
3. Fitness be heritable  

These need not even be biological; for example, you might consider selection acting on language. Words clearly vary in how they are pronounced (phenotypic variation), are used in greater or lesser degrees in certain situations (fitness variation), and our words are passed among generations (they're culturally inherited as well as parentally). 

There has been little direct evidence for the various potential units with which selection could act in a biological system; from the very small (molecules, cells) to the large (ecosystems), Lewontin describes examples of how life can evolve in each realm:

##### Selection of Molecules
- Lewontin argues that molecules were not autocatalytic (they couldn't make more of themselves) thus were not subject to natural selection; while I'm not sure about non-RNA precursors, it's clear that ribozymes are autocatalytic, so he's not entirely correct here.  
- The alternative is to scale up to a level of biological organization similar to a cell, called a *coacervate*. In such a situation the variability in fitness of the unit may be driven by the underlying prebiotic molecules. It's similar to a situation like proteins verus cells versus individuals - you inherit genes, but selection acts on the entirety of the organism, as it's the entire organism required to breed and pass on the cells with the genes. So in this prebiotic state, you need the entire *coacervate* to pass on the variable biological molecules. Nucleic acids and their associated polymerases are the example as a unit of selection at the molecular level.

##### Selection of Organelles
- Mitochonrdia and chloroplasts are targets of selection; while Lewontin provides examples of how heterplasmon (mixtures of non-nuclear genetic material) can be under selection, I wonder if it would be worth while thinking back to the question of why we have a universal maternal ancestry that is traced through mtDNA (and not paternal)? Why did it evolve that we only inherit a single parent's mtDNA but we've partitioned both parent's nuclear DNA? While Lewontin doesn't give any insights, Nick Lane's [review here] [link1] provides some very helpful insights into recent experiments suggesting it's due to the relationship between Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, and the individual capacities of parental mitochondria to resolve ROS problems.

##### Selection of Chromosomes
I'm unclear why Lewontin chose to describe chromosomes after organelles, as a chromosome is a collection of genes whereas an organelle contains the elements of an entire cellular ecosystem. His examples appear to tackle ideas such as chromosomal transversions and copy number as they relate to a population's (typically some *Drosophila*) fitness. I'm unclear if these are actually fair comparisons:
- copy number can explain why one set number of chromosomes is stable, though this is likely an effect in which selectoin is acting on the phenotype of an individual (collection of chromosomes) and thus a population of organisms, not chromosomes
- transversions would work functionally the same way: when fitness of an individual declines, it's relative to the other inidividual flys, not the other flys' chromosomes. 
If there is selection at the chromosome level, I'd argue it's the findings that [Dillon and others] [link2] have worked out, whereby a gene's location on a chromosome *relative to the origin of replication* is what can lead to differential selection pressures on a chromosome (or chromosomes) in a cell.

##### Selection of Cells
Lewontin's remarks about the mesenchymal cell differentiation rang hollow with me. 10,000 cell types? Isn't it just alternative splicing to the rescue here? Nevertheless, cell level selection clearly persists - just think about cancer for a minute. It's also persisting at a variety of developmental stages of any multicellular organism. 

##### FFT and consequences in levels of selection:
1. **The more heritable a character, the faster it *may* evolve**. FFT states that a unit evolves faster when there is more variation in fitness. Likewise, the measure with which some character can influence the fitness of an organism depends on how heritable that character is. So, the more heritable a character, the more it can influence fitness, and thus lead to a greater variance in fitness. Lewontin describes how certain levels of selection contain characters that are more heritable: organelles, haploid cells, and gametes are far more heritable as they don't undergo recombination in the course of their production.  
2. **Time matters. The faster a character reproduces and dies, the faster selection can act**. Another way to mathematically put it: rate of evolutionary response (ie. time) is inversely proportional to the average fitness of a population. Thus if you are producing individuals every 10 years, but producing cells every 10 days, then selection will be operating on the cells in that individual with much more frequency than a group of individuals in a population.

##### Selection of Populations
Two rules stated for population-level effects to occur:
1. Really small population sizes
2. Really fast death rates; constant turnover of individuals.

### Other observations:
- Really liked this quote summarizing FFT on p.8: "The rate of evolution is limited by the variation in fitness of the units being selected".
- In the section titled "**Population Consequences of Individual Selection**" I wondered how these statements could be put into context with genetic drift. Was Lewontin not a big beleiver in neutral evolution as the driving force behind the observed variation in populations? 
- Probably need to read up more on *Kin Selection*. Guessing a lot of work done in this field since this article.
