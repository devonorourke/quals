#Week 2 - O'Rourke notes  

## Paper5: Orr and Coyne 1992 (review)

### Major observations
I'm unclear what the are authors referring to with regards to large and small muations. I think it's the proportional gain in fitness. You don't often see major leaps in fitness, rather, many incrementally small ones. However, in their empirical examples they appear to be classifying mutational size through phenotypes (see Gregory's tests below).

#### Evolution through a few big leaps or many subtle tweaks?
Does adaptatoin proceed through a few large, or many small, changes? In other words, can mutations that are favored under selection occur with large effect, small effect, and if both, to what degree are each important for the evolution of *something*? The two camps as defined in the review:  
1. **Macromutationists** - one or a few alleles produce the material for adaptation  
2. **Micromutationists** - adaptation results from many substitutions of many genes of very small effect  

The middle ground, the authors note, is how Kimura pointed out that while larger mutations may be less frequent, they are more likely to fix. I'd object with this phrasing: mutation *type* may be more or less frequent (indels less often than SNPs, for example), and among a given class (say transitions vs. transversions of SNPs) there may be differences, but it's not like an A-->G substituion in one gene is necessarily more or less likely in another gene.  

The point, I think, is that clasically the probability of *detection* of a mutation is proportional to the probability of it's phenotypic effect. You couldn't detect fitness gains and adaptations of small effect at a single-gene level because you:  
- (a) couldn't sequence single genes with significant frequency
- (b) couldn't produce enough varaition among generations (no one was doing microbial work)
- (c) couldn't quantify fitness by competing between those relatively similar offspring
Short of just blasting some flys with radiation and hoping for a beneficial change, until you do microbial evolution experiments there isn't a way to quantify this.  

**So what was the problem with Fisher's micromutationist argument?  **
1. Though small mutations are more likely to exist (persist?), they aren't necessarily proportionally more likely to fix. Because fixation can be easier with bigger fitness benefits found in larger mutations, it's not an apples:apples comparison; if anything, bigger fitness gains favor bigger mutations.  
2. Adaptive landscapes need not be a single peak. If there are multiple near-optimal phenotypes, a large mutation may kick you off the base of one mountain and way up a second hill. Your fitness would increase dramatically because the worry of interacting disasters is not relevant when there are multiple ways to be near-optimal. My take was that genes exist in networks, and there isn't always a single optimal network.  
3. Mutations aren't uniform in dimensionality. This goes back to the network idea. Some genes act as central hubs where they integrate among many parts; other genes are kind of an outlier portion of a network which likely won't disrupt the system much if a muation does occur. Metabolic changes in the TCA cycle are likely dramatic; changes to production of pigment color under your arm pit are less likely to result in disaster.  

What's the problem with Gregory's empirical tests?
Gregory asserted that large mutations are associated with viability (think 'lethal allele'), while small mutations are associated with morphology. When comparing phenotypes from plants with seeds that were either irradiated (case) or not (control), he found that large mutations were far fewer than small ones (that is, fewer for morphology, more for viability). The problem? His entire freaking design was biased to find mutations with small effect. Oh, and he didn't actually sequence anything.
