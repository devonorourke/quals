## reading list
Initial list generated by Matt MacManes [here] [link1]. Readings organized below are grouped by when we will read them, but numbers are to indicate their position in the original list by MacManes. Links provided when available. A possibly useful addition of papers can be found from an old seminar with Vaughn Cooper [here] [link23].
